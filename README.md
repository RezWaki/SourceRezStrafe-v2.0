# SourceRezStrafe-v2.0
New version of SourceRezStrafe.

# What is SourceRezStrafe?
This is tool for tool-assisted speedruns (TAS) for CS:S & some other Source engine based games

I've checked this tool on CS:S only, so, this tool might works incorrectly for other games

# How to use?
You can heard about yet one tool for TASes, but for Half-Life, so, this tool must be used same as tool for Half-Life, doc:

Here is was basically rewritten strafing system, now strafeangles is calculating By tool, so ini file is useless :p

Compared with my previous version, I've rewritten strafeangles calculating system (now max. strafeangle is 32 & basic strafeangle is 6).
